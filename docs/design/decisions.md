# Design decisions

Decisions Josef has made about Trove's look and feel. Newest first.

## 2026-11-06: direction 4, daylight library (from Josef's photo of a Scandinavian library)

- **Reference:** a pale-wood Scandinavian public library: curved ribs overhead, tall arched windows
  with slender slats, low slanted display units with books face out, sun striping the room.
- **Feedback on the first attempt:** it copied nothing of the photo (stepped blocky units, huge empty
  areas), had no real light, and the brown read greenish. Rebuilt.
- **Now:** honey and peach birch (never beige or olive), gold-white daylight, a vault of diagonal
  ribs as the header, two arched windows (the Librarian's pick stands in the first), full-width
  slanted shelf units with six books each, and diagonal stripes of sun across the whole page. Dense
  by default: no staggered empty steps.
- **Search is a small field in the ceiling.**
- Artboards on the Designs page, row 5: `ScandiPage` (interactive), `ScandiPhone`, `ScandiNotes`.

Pending Josef's review.

## 2026-11-05: back to layout, in black and white

- **None of the Carrara, light-and-shadow or cloth-and-oak looks is the one.** They stay on the
  canvas's first page ("Designs") for reference.
- **Start from form only.** New canvas page "Wireframes": four black-and-white layouts of the shell
  homepage, plain shapes, no material or color: `WireA` (feature, then shelves), `WireB` (side
  rail), `WireC` (bookcase), `WireD` (black split).

Pending Josef's pick.

## 2026-11-05: direction 3, the Carrara page

- **Chosen: option A, the polished white Carrara ledge.** B and C stay on the canvas for reference.
- **Keep the marble shiny and thick,** a little thinner than the study (front edge 50px down to
  42px). Thickness is a tweak on the artboard (slim, regular, thick) for Josef to try.
- **Experiment with reflections:** the books mirror into the polished top, and a lifted book's
  reflection drops away from it. Strength is a tweak (off, soft, mirror).
- **Bring in the light and shadow work from direction 2:** one light from the upper left, depth
  with meaning (carved nav and search, raised buttons, the open book held over the wall), and
  window light only on the Librarian's pick.
- **Search lives in the header,** small. The page opens on the Librarian's pick.
- Artboard: `MarblePage.dc.html`, row 4 of the canvas.

Pending Josef's review.

## 2026-11-05: direction 3 (marble)

- **Search is never the main element of the shelf page.** Making the search bar the hero repeated
  FoundersCircle, which the team disliked. Search stays available but secondary.
- **Direction 2 (light and shadow) is not the one** either; it stays on the canvas for reference.
- **New idea: marble is the material of the shelves.** First step: one shelf with a few books, in
  three options, before any full page. Third row of the canvas: `MarbleA` (polished Carrara
  ledge), `MarbleB` (green marble niche), `MarbleC` (honed pink slab with arch and cube bookends).

Pending Josef's pick.

## 2026-11-05: the shelf page, direction 2 (light and shadow)

- **Direction 1 (cloth and oak) is not the one.** It stays on the canvas for reference.
- **Avoid the tells of AI-made design.** The list is in `docs/design/ai-tells.md`. It guides
  choices without banning basic elements.
- **New direction: shadow is the star.** Very minimal, mostly warm whites; light and shadow
  carry the structure. Slightly retro, slightly Bauhaus, sparing with color. Functional, not a
  gimmick: every depth means something (carved, wall, resting, lifted, held, pressed).
- Built as the second row of the same canvas: `ShadowShelf`, `ShadowPhone`, `ShadowSystem`.

Pending Josef's review.

## 2026-11-05: the shelf page

- **Rejected:** the three poster-style directions from T1 (flat SVG-like covers, layouts designed to
  be looked at rather than used). Removed from `docs/design/`; they're in git history at `bc87a6f`.
- **Start from the user and the interface,** then the look. The shelf is a working screen: search a
  topic, browse, open a book to see its chapters, ask to check it out.
- **One direction only,** polished, built as a canvas of screens rather than a single HTML page:
  `docs/design/shelf/` (published at https://claude.ai/artifact/33uQU8UKZ4gtxcv4ZNof1D).
- **Books are objects, between 2D and 3D.** They have depth, light and shadow and must run efficiently in a
  browser. The design fakes the depth in CSS; the 3D build belongs to UI Implementation, using the
  book object artboard as the spec.
- **Feel:** modern, but serif and library-like, in warm colors.

Pending Josef's review of the new canvas.
